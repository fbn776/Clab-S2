### Code dump!!
A repo for sharing KTU S2 C-Lab exercises.

The codes along with the questions are shared.

The code is subdivided into cycles.
Each cycle has a `Questions.md` file, along with the respective source files with the file names as `ex-[number].c`,
where `[number]` is the exercise number.
`Questions.md` contains the questions for the respective cycle.

    Warning: 
    The code may have bugs, not all were tested.
    This repo contains the code for my S2 CSE C-lab, the exercises might be different for you.
